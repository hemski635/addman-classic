NO LONGER WORKS - WON'T FIX

addman - World of Warcraft addons manager


Install and update addons from curseforge.com and tukui.org
    
    Copy the addman -directory to $home (c:\users\username)
    Remember to edit addon path in addman/addman.ps1, if it's not 
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\addons"
    Previously installed addons are not included. You can manually add them 
    to addman\addonlist.txt, or reinstall them with 'addman -add <addon>'
    (Example: addman -add deadly-boss-mods)
